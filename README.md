# Sensitivity-based-Adversaries

This work includes-
- Training a neural network for MNIST and CIFAR10 Classification and retaining the models for further testing..
- Generation of Adveraries for MNIST and CIFAR10 using IBM ART.
- Implementation of Autoencoder for MNIST 
- Developed a function called sensitivity function which gives the most sensitive neuron for a neural network with 2 hidden layers.
- The function was used to analyse the sensitive pixels of MNIST and also with autoencoder to improve accuracy.
- The function was developed using chain rule and backproagation of error
- Discrete Wavelet Transform  based feature extraction for sensitivity analysis and finding the sensitive features of MNIST and CIFAR10 using simple CNN and testing the same on State-of-the-art neural networks.
